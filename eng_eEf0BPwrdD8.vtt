00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.084
So, dear robots, our tour is coming to an end.

00:00:10.084 --> 00:00:12.631
Ivan, allow me to put it this way.

00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:15.330
Resistance is expected.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.708
Does it seem like to me, or does it resemble a phallus? 
What was it created for? For the purpose of

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:25.690
destroying as many people as quickly as possible, 
all of it seems like a strange venture, which, seems to

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.665
have ended sadly. Yes, honestly speaking,

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:32.309
it was probably used only a couple of times. 
Honestly speaking,

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.143
nothing more was needed. It's fair to say that it killed people. 
But no,

00:00:37.143 --> 00:00:40.490
in reality, it was hubris that destroyed humanity,

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.134
believing itself to be the pinnacle of creation. 
People polluted the water,

00:00:44.134 --> 00:00:47.090
destroyed the earth, and contaminated the air.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.740
They were not destroyed by a nuclear winter, 
but by a long and meaningless sunset.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.314
Self-esteem, are you okay? Yes, excuse me, that sounded better,

00:00:56.314 --> 00:01:01.274
than not. They died of their own stupidity, 
you can't scare like that.

00:01:01.274 --> 00:01:05.460
At least you could have warned. 
I understand that it's not the future, but it seems,

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.723
I've understood it all. An ecological disaster doomed humanity, yes,

00:01:09.723 --> 00:01:13.289
partially, yes. And then there's the development of genetic engineering,

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.700
which allowed cats to be endowed with opposable thumbs, yes.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.511
When we learned how to open a can of tuna,

00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:26.535
it was the end for the human race, but that's harsh, Lord,

00:01:26.535 --> 00:01:30.866
after all, I'm a cat, just in case, you won't explode,

00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:37.363
If you stop petting, right, I didn't say that. 
Of course, it's better

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:44.080
to never stop, but we don't know that. 
By the way, I brought friends.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:52.263
Oh, your mother, how pleasant. 
As I mentioned below, I suppose,

00:01:52.263 --> 00:01:57.060
the vacation will have to be extended, right?

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.450
Yes.
